Welcome to the official GitHub organisation for **CampusCup** — a student-driven, non-profit initiative based at the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU). Since 2014, we've been orchestrating the annual **Battle of the Canal**, a spirited kayak and beer relay race that brings together students from ITU and the University of Copenhagen's Faculty of Humanities (KUA).

## 🎉 About the Event

Held every September at Emil Holms Kanal, CampusCup is more than just a race. It's a carnival-like celebration featuring:

- 🛶 **16 teams** competing in a knockout-style kayak and beer relay race.
- 🎶 **Live entertainment**, sponsor booths, and interactive games.

Whether you're racing, volunteering, or cheering from the sidelines, CampusCup offers an unforgettable experience.
